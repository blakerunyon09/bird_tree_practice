--------------
Objectives:
--------------
<!-- Y'all will be creating a Rails API from scratch with CRUD, and use Postman (at the least) to test it -->
<!-- Create a Rails API -->
<!-- Create the Bird class -->
<!-- Seed your Database with 3 Birds -->
<!-- Index, Show, and Create actions for Birds -->
<!-- Use rails routes, rails console, and Postman to test each piece of your API (routes, database, and actions respectively) -->
---------
Bonus:
---------
<!-- If you complete all the objectives above. -->
<!-- Add Update action to Birds. -->
<!-- Add Destroy action to Birds. -->
<!-- Verify that they both work. -->
----------------
Extra Bonus:
----------------
<!-- If you finish ALL THAT above. -->
<!-- Make a second model for Tree. -->
<!-- Make a 1:M relationship (Tree has many birds and a Bird belongs to a tree). Also, you get super bonus points for migrating forward (as opposed to rolling back) -->
Be able to create a Bird using Postman so that it belongs to a Tree
If you complete that, then have your Bird index action response have all birds and also the entire tree hash each bird belongs to

Ask for help!
Please reach out if you cannot figure something out.
Don't spend 30 minutes deleting and creating files, or trying to migrate and/or seed without making any progress.
Small/bite size pieces -as per usual. One lil bit at a time. Don't code the whole thing at once.
Test everything! rails routes, rails console, postman, byebug, etc
